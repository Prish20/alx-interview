# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation - Task 0

## Task 0: UTF-8 Validation

### Description

In this task, we implemented a function `validUTF8` that checks if a given list of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 characters can be 1 to 4 bytes long, and the function ensures that each character follows the proper UTF-8 encoding rules.

**`Prototype`**

```python
def validUTF8(data)
```
